	<body><h1>How to use JComic</h1><pre>
	
	The bulk of JComic's functionality shouldn't require explaining, but there are settings
	that you shouldn't change if you don't understand what they do. Similarly, if there's
	something about JComic that you don't understand, you should refer to the manual.
	
	This page acts as a quick-reference guide. 
	The full manual is available at <a href="http://jcomic.japanzai.com/index.html">jcomic.japanzai.com</a>
	
	</pre><h2>How to start</h2><pre>
	
	On the main screen there are six buttons. The one on the far left (a picture of a book)
	will take you to a file selection screen. From there you can navigate through the contents
	of your device.
	When you find an image you want to view, simply tap on it.
	Similarly, should you find an archive you want to read the contents of, simply tap on it.
	
	</pre><h2>Default functionality</h2><pre>
	
	When reading with JComic, by default:
		
	-Images are scaled to their width. This means that wide images are zoomed out and 
	tall images are zoomed in.
	
	-Tapping twice on an image that has been loaded will alter the zoom.
	The zoom cycles between Auto, 100%, and whatever you have chosen as the default zoom
	in General Settings (Auto by default).
	
	-Pinching an image will make it zoom out (up to 1/10 of the original size).
	The opposite will zoom in (up to 5x the original size).
		
	-Swiping to the left will display the next supported image. Swiping to the right 
	will display the preceding supported image.
		
	-Swiping up and down will do nothing <b>unless</b> the image you are viewing is 
	too tall to be displayed. In that case, swiping up and down is the same as scrolling 
	up and down the image.
		
	-Changing the orientation of your device when reading (eg. turning it on its side) 
	will cause the image currently displayed to be resized to fit the new width. 
	For example, if you're reading a comic in portrait mode (device is upright) and change 
	it to landscape mode (device appears to be widescreen), the image will be zoomed in so 
	that its width fills the widescreen display, allowing you to scroll up and down to see 
	the rest of the image.
	
	<h2>Supported formats</h2>
	
	JComic also handles a few other formats, but the following are completely supported.
	
	Supported image formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp (Android 4.0+)
		
	Supported archive formats: zip, rar, cbz, cbr, ar, tar
