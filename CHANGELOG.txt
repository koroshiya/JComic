-Version 1.13.0

Added setting to enable/disable caching of RAR archives
disabled RAR caching by default
fixed order when viewing individual pages
fixed order of zip archives
fixed scan option

-Version 1.12.0

Mostly cleanup.
Bugfix: "cache on start" checkbox setting is now saved properly

-Version 1.11.0

Moved up, cancel & home to a "shelf" above the file chooser listview
Added refresh to the shelf
Waiting for an uncached page now invokes the Progress screen
Updated Apache Commons Compress to v1.9 (I think it was v1.5 before)
Removed several unused classes related to archiving
Altered Rar to throw an exception if a memory error is encountered during file extraction

-Version 1.10.0

Removed remaining (now-defunct) ad definition
Removed back to file chooser option
Removed ability to extract archives from filechooser
Removed alternate main layout
Fixed bug pertaining to order of file names

Overhauled backend of UI so that it now uses separate activities rather than a view flipper. This should (theoretically) improve performance, since images are properly discarded with the activity rather than relying on GC with each, there are fewer views present on the activity, etc.

-Version 1.09.11

Re-implemented ability to click on "re-enable in General Settings" as link.
Fixed bug in aforementioned link where the link would open 2 activities.
Fixed bug where image clicked within directory would instead display first image in directory.

-Version 1.09.10

Fixed two minor UI bugs for list items
List items now have icons to indicate file types (eg. image, archive, zip)
Updated target SDK to 21

-Version 1.09.9

Workaround for NPE caused by null image object in image switcher

-Version 1.09.8

Fixed missing strings which were causing errors for certain locales

-Version 1.09.7

Removed ads
Removed internet permissions
Added 0 size check for image files when indexing
Added 0 size check for all files when listing in file viewer
Added null check to JImageView. Stops warnings in the eclipse
layout viewer, and may inadvertantly fix certain crashes
Removed RAR password stuff

-Version 1.09.6

Added excessive error handling to settings pages [1]

[1] A bit overzealous, but basically every individual setting is now checked and loaded individually.
This is because certain resources are reported as missing, but only on the minority of devices.
The resources are always present, and there's no issue with the underlying resource, hence this over the top method.

-Version 1.09.5

Project made open source and moved to github
Removed direct sdcard methods and used Environment methods instead

-Version 1.09.4

Removed custom error logging altogether. It was causing more problems than it was fixing.


-Version 1.09.3

Workaround for crash on some devices pertaining to error logging[1]

[1] When JComic encounters an error, the report is logged so that it can be sent when JComic is next online.
 On some devices, attempting to write/access/send the error log caused a crash.
 This workaround attempts to fix crashes where an error log cannot be send, read, or written to.


-Version 1.09.1

Added groundwork for experimental support for encrypted and password-protected RAR archives[1]
Added better error reporting for Settings screen[2]

[1] Nothing that users will notice just yet, except that protected/encrypted RAR archives may throw a different error.
 As stated, this feature will allow for the use of encrypted/password-protected RAR archives in future releases.
[2] For most users, the Settings screen works fine. For some, however, it crashes immediately, leaving the user unable to change any settings and without any errors to report.
 Now, errors thrown by the Settings screen will be logged and reported in the same way as errors encountered while reading comics. Some crashes from the Settings screen will also be circumvented completely.


-Version 1.09

Updated for Android 4.4[1]
Added context menu[2] and setting to disable context menu
Added ability to jump to specific page[3]
Added context menu entries to go straight to first/last page
Fix for restore default "keep zoom on page change" setting
Added setting to return from comic to file chooser instead of main page[4]
Removed legacy "menu" options

[1] Update for Android 4.4 untested; won't have access to an Android 4.4 device until Google start rolling out the update to their nexus 7 devices
[2] Context (popup) menu can be opened while reading by performing a long press on the image being viewed.
 ie. While reading a comic, press and hold down on the image without dragging your finger.
[3] The method varies slightly for older versions of Android.
 The NumberPicker control wasn't introduced until Android 3.0, so 2.3.x devices use a dropdown list instead.
 The end result is the same, but the controls are different.
[4] Because of the way JComic works, the current implementation will flash the main page for a moment rather than go straight to the file chooser page.
 In reality, there is no change; the main page and comic reader are two sides of the same coin, and the file chooser is only accessible from the main page.


-Version 1.08.5

Added proper handling for fake/broken ZIP files
Fixed error handling for IO errors and broken/invalid RAR files
Recent list is now searched for files selected from the Files and Favorites tabs [1]

[1] Previously, recently read archives/folders could be resumed from the main page (for the very last one) and the Recent tab in the file chooser (up to 10 most recent). Choosing the same file from the Favorites or Files tab would take you back to page one.
 Now, files chosen from those two tabs are checked against the recent files list.


-Version 1.08.4

Changed default recursion setting
Fixed file naming for recursive folder searches[1]

[1] Previously, recursive folder searches might, depending on the file names, display the images out of order.


-Version 1.08.3

Fix for rotation of images while reading


-Version 1.08.2

Fix for mixed-language file name sorting


-Version 1.08.1

Added missing French translations


-Version 1.08

*French translations NOT complete
Implemented zip and zip & delete features [1]
Implemented extract and extract & delete features [2]
Improved archive extraction
Replaced archive mode Extract with Progressive extraction [3]
Updates made to offline error logging service
Fixed & improved .ar/.tar support
Updated third-party library ActionBarSherlock
Updated Credits screen/functionality
Implemented error reporting service/interface
Fixed orientation change for main screen
Added support for Android 4.3
Fixed network bug responsible for occasional crashes
Implemented workaround for backlight bug affecting some devices

[1] In the file chooser, these two options have been added to the context menu.
 Press and hold a directory to see these two options.
 The first will take all of the supported images from within a directory and create a ZIP archive.
 The latter will do the same, then delete the original folder.
[2] Same as [1], except you press and hold a supported archive and extract its contents to a folder.
[3] Rather than extract every supported image within an archive at once, this option allows for extraction as you read.
 eg. An archive is loaded. While the first image is being viewed, the next image is extracted and cached from disk.
 This option provides significant improvements for RAR/CBR archives.


-Version 1.07

Implemented cache safety feature and setting
Fixed double tap
Implemented double tap settings (General > Double tap)
Added cache on startup setting
Implemented keep zoom on page change feature/setting
Changed default setting for dynamic resizing
JComic now uses less RAM when caching multiple images

-Version 1.06

Improved closing of archives
The Recent list now keeps track of page numbers
Fixed minor issue with bi-directional caching
Implemented Pinch to Zoom


-Version 1.05

Updated external libraries
Fixed double tap zoom cycling [1]
Altered Auto zoom behavior [2]
Implemented scale to height & width zoom options

[1] Double tap was supposed to cycle through Default > 100% > Auto
 However, after the first cycle, Default was no longer reachable.
 That functionality has now been fixed.
[2] Previously, all images would scale to the device's width.
 Now, only images that are too wide will scale. ie. Small images aren't stretched.


-Version 1.04

Implemented offline error logging and sending [1]
Fixed page number bug [2]
Fixed positioning for small images [3]

[1] If a fatal error occurs while you are offline, JComic will log the error.
 The next time you start JComic, if you have an active internet connection, you will be prompted to email the developer an error report.
[2] The current page number was being saved across files, meaning if you reached page X in one archive and opened another, JComic would try to go straight to that page.
[3] Images smaller than a device's screen (or zoomed out) are now centered.


-Version 1.03

Hidden file & MACOSX folder handling added [1]
Added missing French translations
Addressed setCacheIndex crash [2]
[1] Previously, hidden files were not read properly, and archives made on OSX systems would try to load some entries twice
[2] One user reported a NullPointerException when resuming reading from an archive.
 As of v1.03, the issue should no longer exist.


-Version 1.02

Directory now keeps place on resume
Added experimental support for .webp (Android 4.0+)


-Version 1.01
